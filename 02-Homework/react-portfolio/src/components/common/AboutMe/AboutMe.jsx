            Hi There, My name is Noah Schlag, i'm a 21 year old from bloomington, Minnesota who just finished a coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota. My passions include: Photography, cooking, and collecting records.(there is nothing like the sound of uncompressed vinal)I have really enjoyed my time in the coding bootcamp, you could also say it was the hardest six months of my life as well though. The bootcamp takes a lot of time and attention to be successful in the class, and not everybody succeeds. I would recommend taking the course if you're a determined person who can sit down and really try at something for multiple hours a day. You can find some of my photography work in portfolio portion of the website, and 3 of the projects I did with a group in the coding portfolio section. My contact information is in...you guessed it contact. Hope you enjoy the website I built while you're here.
